\section*{{\Huge {\sf ABSTRACT}}}
%% \begin{center}

{\color{udsect}
We present first implementation \cite{fp} of hadronic cascade model INCL 4.2
\cite{incl} and evaporation model ABLA V3 \cite{abla} in Geant4 9.1 \cite{g4}.
\vskip0.5cm
INCL and ABLA models play an important role in simulating the behaviour of high energy physics
detector systems such as Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at LHC:
\begin{itemize}
\item improving shielding
\item understanding radiation damage, and
\item activation and background studies
\end{itemize}
In nuclear physics
applications these models are typically used for spallation studies.
% (See Fig. \ref{fig:fig}).

% INCL4 and ABLA physics validation, using the ROOT \cite{rootwebsite}
% data analysis package developed at CERN.  This validation framework
% allows scripting of simulation parameters, such as target material,
% thickness, beam particle type, energy and the physics models.
%
% using an interface layer, and are comparing the physics performance
% against existing Geant4 models. We work together with the original
% developers from Li\`ege University, GSI and CEA to convert this
% FORTRAN-C++ hybrid system first to procedural C-implementation and
% further to fully object oriented C++ code. This redesign and rewrite
% will make it easier to maintain and .
%
% We have translated the FORTRAN based INCL 4.2 and ABLA V3 codes to C++
% and connected them to Geant4 \cite{geant4Site} hadronic physics
% framework making further development of these models possible. (TODO:)

%One feature of INCL is low number of free model parameters.
%The most imporant parameter of INCL is the stopping time, $t_{stop}$,

\section*{{\Huge {\sf INCL PARAMETERS}}}
%\section*{\textbf{\Large\color{udsubsect}\underline{INCL parameters}}}

INCL introduces \emph{only two free parameters}:
\begin{itemize}
\item potential depth and
\item stopping time
$t_{stop}$, defined as the point in time when the cascade is
finished and evaporation starts:
\begin{equation}
t_{stop} = f_{stop}t_0 (A_{target}/208) ^{0.16}.
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
Here $A_{target}$ is the target mass number, $t_0 = 70 fm/c$, and
$f_{stop}$ is a scaling factor for the stopping time \cite{g4physref}.
% Good default value for this factor is $f_{stop}$ = 1.0

\section*{{\Huge {\sf ABLA EVAPORATION}}}
The probabilities for emission of particle type $j = {p, n, \alpha}$
are calculated using formula:
\begin{equation}
W_j(N,Z,E) = \frac{\Gamma_j(N,Z,E)}{\sum_k\Gamma_k(N,Z,E)},
\label{eqn:probabilities}
\end{equation}
where $\Gamma_j$ is emission width for particle $j$, $N$ is neutron
number, $Z$ charge number and $E$ excitation energy.
\vskip0.5cm

Emission widths are calculated using the following formula:
\index{emission width}
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_j = \frac{1}{2 \pi \rho_c(E)} \frac{4 m_j R^2}{\hbar^2} T_j^2 \rho_j(E - S_j - B_j),
\label{eqn:emissionwidth}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\rho_c(E)$ and $\rho_j(E - S_j - B_j)$ are the level densities
of the compound nucleus and the exit channel, respectively.
\item $B_j$ is the height of the Coulomb barrier,
\item $S_j$ the separation energy,
\item $R$ is the radius,
\item $T_j$ the temperature of the remnant nucleus after
emission, and
\item $m_j$ the mass of the emitted particle.
\end{itemize}
