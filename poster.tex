\section*{{\Huge {\sf ABSTRACT}}}
%% \begin{center}
%% \textsf{\Large\color{udsubsect}\underline{ABSTRACT}}
%% \end{center}

We discuss the status of INCL intra-nuclear cascade and ABLA fission/de-excitation codes
in the latest release of the detector simulation toolkit Geant4 9.2 \cite{pk09aCollaboration, pk08aProceedings}.
The INCL model is well established for targets heavier than Aluminium
and projectile energies from $\sim$ 150 MeV up to 2.5 GeV $\sim$ 3 GeV \cite{pk08bProceedings}. 

We present a new Geant4 physics list prepared for nuclear physics applications
in the domain dominated by spallation.
Validity of the Geant4 physics list is demonstrated from the perspective of accelerator driven systems
and EURISOL project, especially with the neutron double differential cross sections and residual
nuclei production.
An example application utilizing the physics list is introduced.
Finally, an ongoing work to improve of the physics models for the treatment of 
light targets (Carbon - Oxygen) and light ion beams (up to Carbon) (Fig.~1) are discussed.

\section*{{\Huge {\sf INCL PARAMETERS}}}
%\section*{\textbf{\Large\color{udsubsect}\underline{INCL parameters}}}
{\color{udsect}
Li\`ege intra-nuclear cascade, {\sf INCL}, \cite{incl} requires \emph{only two free parameters}:
\begin{itemize}
\item potential depth, and
\item stopping time, $t_{stop}$, defined as the point in time when the cascade is
finished and evaporation starts:
\begin{equation}
t_{stop} = f_{stop}t_0 (A_{target}/208) ^{0.16}.
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
Here $A_{target}$ is the target mass number, $t_0 = 70 fm/c$, and
$f_{stop}$ is a scaling factor for the stopping time \cite{g4incl}.
\vskip0.5cm

The number of parameters is kept low in order to have as much
\emph{predictive power} as possible.
}
% Good default value for this factor is $f_{stop}$ = 1.0

\section*{{\Huge {\sf PHYSICS LIST}}}
{\color{udsect}

New physics list called {\sf QGSP\_INCLABLA} has been implemented with
spallation users in mind. This list uses INCL/ABLA models for proton,
neutron and pion inelastic interactions in the energy range 0 - 3
GeV. In this energy range INCL/ABLA is the only model used for the
aforementioned processes.

{\sf INCL} can now be used with the {\sf Geant4} Fermi break-up
model. In order to choose between ABLA and Fermi break-up we have
introduced a selection rule in the code. Currently cascade remnant
nuclei lighter than A < 13 are handled using Fermi break-up.

\section*{{\Huge {\sf Geant4 Physics lists}}}
{\tt Geant4} physics models, cross sections and processes are
decoupled using abstract interfaces.
\begin{itemize}
\item Allow alternative implementations
\item The system can be extended
\item Users can run their simulation using different physics model
configuration and compare the results
\item Allow users to find good balance between various goals (e.g. CPU
time requirements vs. accuracy of results)
\item Each application must define explicitly what physics
configuration to use
\end{itemize}

The options are: use a \emph{reference physics list} or build your
own.

\begin{itemize}
\item Everything related to physics is a \emph{process}.
\item Each particle has a pointer to its \emph{particle definition}.
\item Particle definition has exactly one \emph{process manager}.
\item Process manager keeps track of different processes assigned to the particle.
\item Process has cross section and a model associated with it.

\section*{{\Huge {\sf ABLA EVAPORATION}}}
{\color{udsect}
The ablation code {\sf ABLA} \cite{abla} for evaporation and fission modeling is developed at GSI, Darmstadt.
\vskip0.5cm

The probabilities for emission of particle type $j$ = \{$p$, $n$, $\alpha$\}
are calculated using formula:
\begin{equation}
W_j(N,Z,E) = \frac{\Gamma_j(N,Z,E)}{\sum_k\Gamma_k(N,Z,E)},
\label{eqn:probabilities}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is neutron
number, $Z$ charge number and $E$ excitation energy.
\vskip0.5cm

The emission width, $\Gamma_j$, for particle $j$ is defined as:
\index{emission width}
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_j = \frac{1}{2 \pi \rho_c(E)} \frac{4 m_j R^2}{\hbar^2} T_j^2 \rho_j(E - S_j - B_j),
\label{eqn:emissionwidth}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\rho_c(E)$ and $\rho_j(E - S_j - B_j)$ are the level densities
of the compound nucleus and the exit channel, respectively.
\item $B_j$ the height of the Coulomb barrier,
\item $S_j$ the separation energy,
\item $R$ the radius,
\item $T_j$ the temperature of the remnant nucleus after
emission, and
\item $m_j$ the mass of the emitted particle.
\end{itemize}
