{\color{udsect}
We present first implementation of hadronic cascade model INCL 4.2
\cite{incl} and evaporation model ABLA V3 \cite{abla} in Geant4 9.1.
\vskip0.5cm
These codes play an important role in many nuclear physics
applications, such as spallation studies. (See Fig. \ref{fig:fig}).
% The hadronic cascade model INCL4 \cite{incl} and de-excitation model
% ABLA \cite{abla} play an important role in nuclear physics
% applications and simulating the behaviour of high energy physics
% detector systems such as Compact Muon Solenoid experiment at Large
% Hadron Collider. 
%
% INCL4 and ABLA physics validation, using the ROOT \cite{rootwebsite}
% data analysis package developed at CERN.  This validation framework
% allows scripting of simulation parameters, such as target material,
% thickness, beam particle type, energy and the physics models.
%
% using an interface layer, and are comparing the physics performance
% against existing Geant4 models. We work together with the original
% developers from Li\`ege University, GSI and CEA to convert this
% FORTRAN-C++ hybrid system first to procedural C-implementation and
% further to fully object oriented C++ code. This redesign and rewrite
% will make it easier to maintain and .
%
% We have translated the FORTRAN based INCL 4.2 and ABLA V3 codes to C++
% and connected them to Geant4 \cite{geant4Site} hadronic physics
% framework making further development of these models possible. (TODO:)

%One feature of INCL is low number of free model parameters.
%The most imporant parameter of INCL is the stopping time, $t_{stop}$,

\section*{\color{udsect} Theory}

Notably, INCL introduces \emph{only two free parameters}: potential depth
and the stopping time
$t_{stop}$, defined as the point in time when the cascade is
finished and evaporation starts:
\begin{equation}
t_{stop} = f_{stop}t_0 (A_{target}/208) ^{0.16}.
\end{equation}
Here $A_{target}$ is the target mass number, $t_0 = 70 fm/c$, and
$f_{stop}$ is a scaling factor for the stopping time \cite{g4physref}.
% Good default value for this factor is $f_{stop}$ = 1.0
