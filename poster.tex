\section*{{\Huge {\sf ABSTRACT}}}
%% \begin{center}
%% \textsf{\Large\color{udsubsect}\underline{ABSTRACT}}
%% \end{center}

We introduce the first implementation \cite{fp} of the hadronic cascade model {\sf INCL 4.2}
\cite{incl} and evaporation/fission model {\sf ABLA V3} \cite{abla} in {\sf Geant4 9.1} detector simulation toolkit \cite{g4}.
\vskip0.5cm

% FIXME ``makes it possible''
{\sf INCL} and {\sf ABLA} codes provide microscopic models especially validated for simulation of spallation reactions.  The
inclusion of these models in {\sf Geant4} makes it possible to use them
for LHC detector simulations. Additional uses for the models include:
\begin{itemize}
\item shielding studies,
\item understanding radiation damage, and
\item activation and background studies.
\end{itemize}

\section*{{\Huge {\sf INCL PARAMETERS}}}
%\section*{\textbf{\Large\color{udsubsect}\underline{INCL parameters}}}
{\color{udsect}
Li\`ege intra-nuclear cascade, {\sf INCL}, \cite{incl} requires \emph{only two free parameters}:
\begin{itemize}
\item potential depth, and
\item stopping time, $t_{stop}$, defined as the point in time when the cascade is
finished and evaporation starts:
\begin{equation}
t_{stop} = f_{stop}t_0 (A_{target}/208) ^{0.16}.
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
Here $A_{target}$ is the target mass number, $t_0 = 70 fm/c$, and
$f_{stop}$ is a scaling factor for the stopping time \cite{g4incl}.
\vskip0.5cm

The number of parameters is kept low in order to have as much
\emph{predictive power} as possible.
}
% Good default value for this factor is $f_{stop}$ = 1.0

\section*{{\Huge {\sf ABLA EVAPORATION}}}
{\color{udsect}
The ablation code {\sf ABLA} \cite{abla} for evaporation and fission modeling is developed at GSI, Darmstadt.
\vskip0.5cm

The probabilities for emission of particle type $j$ = \{$p$, $n$, $\alpha$\}
are calculated using formula:
\begin{equation}
W_j(N,Z,E) = \frac{\Gamma_j(N,Z,E)}{\sum_k\Gamma_k(N,Z,E)},
\label{eqn:probabilities}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is neutron
number, $Z$ charge number and $E$ excitation energy.
\vskip0.5cm

The emission width, $\Gamma_j$, for particle $j$ is defined as:
\index{emission width}
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_j = \frac{1}{2 \pi \rho_c(E)} \frac{4 m_j R^2}{\hbar^2} T_j^2 \rho_j(E - S_j - B_j),
\label{eqn:emissionwidth}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\rho_c(E)$ and $\rho_j(E - S_j - B_j)$ are the level densities
of the compound nucleus and the exit channel, respectively.
\item $B_j$ the height of the Coulomb barrier,
\item $S_j$ the separation energy,
\item $R$ the radius,
\item $T_j$ the temperature of the remnant nucleus after
emission, and
\item $m_j$ the mass of the emitted particle.
\end{itemize}
