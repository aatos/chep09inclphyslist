%% \end{center}

%We discuss the status of INCL intra-nuclear cascade and ABLA fission/de-excitation codes
%in the latest release of the detector simulation toolkit {\sf Geant4 9.2} \cite{pk09aCollaboration, pk08aProceedings}.

We have introduced {\sf INCL} \cite{incl} intra-nuclear cascade model in {\sf Geant4 9.2} \cite{g4}.
The {\sf INCL} model is well established for targets heavier than Aluminium
and projectile energies from $\sim$ 150 MeV up to 2.5 GeV $\sim$ 3 GeV \cite{pk08bProceedings}. 

\vspace{1cm}
{\color{udsect}
We present a new {\sf Geant4} physics list, based on {\sf INCL} and {\sf ABLA} models, 
prepared for nuclear physics applications
in the domain dominated by spallation.
}

\vspace{1cm}
Validity of this new {\sf Geant4} physics list 
is demonstrated from the perspective of accelerator driven systems
and EURISOL project.

%especially with the neutron double differential cross sections and residual nuclei production.
%An example application utilizing the physics list is introduced.

\section*{{\Huge {\sf INCL PARAMETERS}}}
%\section*{\textbf{\Large\color{udsubsect}\underline{INCL parameters}}}
{\color{udsect}
Li\`ege intra-nuclear cascade, {\sf INCL}, \cite{incl} requires \emph{only two free parameters}:
\begin{itemize}
\item potential depth, and
\item stopping time, $t_{stop}$, defined as the point in time when the cascade is
finished and evaporation starts:
\begin{equation}
t_{stop} = f_{stop}t_0 (A_{target}/208) ^{0.16}.
\end{equation}
\end{itemize}
Here $A_{target}$ is the target mass number, $t_0 = 70 fm/c$, and
$f_{stop}$ is a scaling factor for the stopping time \cite{g4incl}.
\vskip0.5cm

The number of parameters is kept low in order to have as much
\emph{predictive power} as possible.
}
% Good default value for this factor is $f_{stop}$ = 1.0

\section*{{\Huge {\sf GEANT4 PHYSICS LISTS}}}

A unique feature of {\sf Geant4} is to  
\emph{decouple physics models, cross sections, and processes}
using abstract interfaces, and manage the usage of different options with so-called the physics lists.


\begin{itemize}
{\color{udsect}
\item Physics lists allow users to find good balance between various goals (e.g. CPU
time requirements vs. accuracy of results).
}
\item Also, users can run their simulation using different physics model
configurations and compare the results.
%\item Allow alternative implementations

\item Further, the {\sf Geant4} physics system can be easily extended.
%\item Each application must define explicitly what physics
%configuration to use
\end{itemize}

%\begin{comment}
%The options are: use a \emph{reference physics list} or build your own.
%\begin{itemize}
%\item Everything related to physics is a \emph{process}.
%\item Each particle has a pointer to its \emph{particle definition}.
%\item Particle definition has exactly one \emph{process manager}.
%\item Process manager keeps track of different processes assigned to the particle.
%\item Process has cross section and a model associated with it.

This list uses {\sf INCL/ABLA} models for proton,

\section*{{\Huge {\sf ABLA EVAPORATION}}}
{\color{udsect}
The ablation code {\sf ABLA} \cite{abla} for evaporation and fission modeling is developed at GSI, Darmstadt.
\vskip0.5cm

The probabilities for emission of particle type $j$ = \{$p$, $n$, $\alpha$\}
are calculated using formula:
\begin{equation}
W_j(N,Z,E) = \frac{\Gamma_j(N,Z,E)}{\sum_k\Gamma_k(N,Z,E)},
\label{eqn:probabilities}
\end{equation}
where $N$ is neutron
number, $Z$ charge number and $E$ excitation energy.
\vskip0.5cm

The emission width, $\Gamma_j$, for particle $j$ is defined as:
\index{emission width}
\begin{equation}
\Gamma_j = \frac{1}{2 \pi \rho_c(E)} \frac{4 m_j R^2}{\hbar^2} T_j^2 \rho_j(E - S_j - B_j),
\label{eqn:emissionwidth}
\end{equation}
where:
\begin{itemize}
\item $\rho_c(E)$ and $\rho_j(E - S_j - B_j)$ are the level densities
of the compound nucleus and the exit channel, respectively.
\item $B_j$ the height of the Coulomb barrier,
\item $S_j$ the separation energy,
\item $R$ the radius,
\item $T_j$ the temperature of the remnant nucleus after
emission, and
\item $m_j$ the mass of the emitted particle.
