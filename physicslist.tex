INCL/ABLA models can now be used via physics list {\tt
QGSP\_INCL\_ABLA}. The list is based on widely used {\tt QGSP\_BERT}
physics list. In the new list we use INCL/ABLA models instead of the
Bertini cascade.

The INCL/ABLA models are used for proton, neutron, pi+ and pi-
inelastic processes in the energy range 0 - 3 GeV. Above this
threshold QGSP model is used. Since this list is intended for
spallation and ADS applications we have not optimized the physics
performance for energies higher than 3 GeV. In order to extend the
list for high energy applications another model is probably needed
between QGSP and INCL/ABLA.

The class reference documentation of the INCL/ABLA models is produced
using Doxygen \cite{doxygen} documentation generator. It allows us to
produce full documentation of the class structure complete with usage
instructions, class diagrams, detailed descriptions of all methods and
code listings.
