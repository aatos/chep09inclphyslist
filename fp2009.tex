We discuss the status of INCL intra-nuclear cascade and ABLA fission/de-excitation codes
in the latest relase of the detector simulation toolkit Geant4 9.2 \cite{pk09aCollaboration}.
The INCL model is well established for targets heavier than Aluminium
and projectile energies from $\sim$ 150 MeV up to 2.5 GeV $\sim$ 3 GeV \cite{pk08bProceedings}. 

%Improvements of the physics models are foreseen for the treatment of light targets (Carbon - Oxygen)
%and light ion beams (up to Carbon) and will be discussed.
%Outside this domain (light nuclei and energies down to 20-30 MeV)
%the model can be tried but the capabilities have yet to be established.
%such as spallation reactions in Accelerator Driven Systems.
%%% The following minipage structures are needed to position the figure
%%% beside the text paragraph.
%%% For a standard figure environment, see the example below.
%\begin{minipage}{9cm}
We present a new Geant4 physics list prepared for nuclear physics applications
in the domain dominated by spallation.
Validity of the Geant4 physics list is demonstrated from the perspective of accelerator driven systems
and EURISOL project, especially with the neutron double differential cross sections and residual
nuclei production.
An example application utilizing the physics list is introduced.
%
Finally, an ongoing work to improve of the physics models for the treatment of 
light targets (Carbon - Oxygen) and light ion beams (up to Carbon) are discussed.
Finally, an ongoing work to improve of the physics models for the treatment of 
light targets (Carbon - Oxygen) and light ion beams (up to Carbon) (see Fig.) are discussed.
