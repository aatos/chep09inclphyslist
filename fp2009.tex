We present a new Geant4 physics list prepared for nuclear physics applications
in the domain dominated by spallation.
We discuss new Geant4 models based on the translation of 
INCL intra-nuclear cascade and ABLA de-excitation codes in C++   
and used in the physic list.
The INCL model is well established for targets heavier than Aluminium
and projectile energies from $\sim$ 150 MeV up to 2.5 GeV $\sim$ 3 GeV. 
Validity of the Geant4 physics list is demonstrated from the perspective of accelerator driven systems
and EURISOL project, especially with the neutron double differential cross sections and residual
nuclei production.
Foreseen improvements of the physics models for the treatment of light targets (Carbon - Oxygen)
and light ion beams (up to Carbon) are discussed.
%Improvements of the physics models are foreseen for the treatment of light targets (Carbon - Oxygen)
%and light ion beams (up to Carbon) and will be discussed.
An example application utilizing the physics list is introduced.
%Outside this domain (light nuclei and energies down to 20-30 MeV)
%the model can be tried but the capabilities have yet to be established.
%such as spallation reactions in Accelerator Driven Systems.
