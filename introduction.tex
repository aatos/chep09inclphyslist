An unique feature of Geant4 is physics list concept providing transparent access 
to various physics models. 
Often an optional models are available with specific strengths and limitations, 
so physics lists concept is used to
provide optimal set of functionality for specific use case.

In this paper we are interested on issues relevant to nuclear physics applications,
neutron production and modelling of spallation reactions.

This paper is organized as follows:
key Geant4 models (intra-nuclear cascade INCL or Liege cascade, and ABLA evaporation-fission model) 
applied in this work are introduced in Sec.~\ref{sec:models},
Sec.~\ref{sec:list} documents the details of physics list implementation, and
Sec.~\ref{sec:example} describes an example application utilizing the new physics list
for the use case of spallation reaction study.
Physics performance is demonstrated particularly for 
neutron  cross sections in Sec.~\ref{sec:performance} and
Sec.~\ref{sec:conclusion} concludes with outline of future models developments.
